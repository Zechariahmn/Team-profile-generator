In order for the user to use this repo, they must first clone down the repo so they have the necessary package.json and node modules along with the other files needed for the application to work. The application can then be started by the user typing the command [node index.js] into the terminal command line. After the user has started the application they will be prompted witha series of questions to input the information of the team members they wish to generate profiles for. Once the user has input all the information needed and created the necessary amount of member profiles they wish for they can input the [N] command once prompted with the [y/N] choice and the application will then create a tailor made index.html file for the users specific team with all their information. the user can then open up their index.html file in a default browser to see their finished product.
